#### Advanced_Desk

Hello. This is a windows forms applicaiton intended for creating a resume website to impress employers. It is completely drag and drop, and makes HTML programming a breeze.

#### Editing Elements  
* Left click on the element in **CURRENT SITE** and it will appear in the **ATTRIBUTE EDITOR**. You can change attributes of elements here. 

#### Moving Elements 
* Right click on an element in **CURRENT SITE**, and your cursor will shift to a grasping hand. Drag your element where you want and then drop it, and it will update the order of the items by putting the item you dragged before the element you dropped it on. 

#### Deleteing Elements 
* Left click the element you want to delete in **CURRENT SITE**, and then press the "Delete Item" button on the right by the **ATTRIBUTE EDITOR** to remove it.

#### Changing Element Display Names 
* The "displayName" attribute is a special attribute that all HTML elements have. It is how the element appears in the **CURRENT SITE** box. A user can change this field to keep track of elements. Pressing "Refresh Item" will reload the currently selected item so it 
displays the proper name. Pressing "Refresh List" will perform this process on all items in the list. NOTE THAT non displayName attribute changes will still happen on a site generate, even if you haven't refreshed the items.
